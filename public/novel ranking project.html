<h3>Againts the Gods</h3>
<p>
  Mythical Abode Mountain, Cloud’s End Cliff, the most dangerous of Azure Cloud
  Continent’s four deadly areas. Cloud’s End Cliff’s base is known as the Grim
  Reaper’s Cemetery. Over countless years, the number of people that have fallen
  off this cliff is too high to count. None of them, even three stronger than
  god masters, whose power could pierce the heavens, have been able to return
  alive. However, a boy that’s being chased by various people because he alone
  holds a priceless treasure jumps off the cliff, but instead of dying he wakes
  up in the body of a boy with the same name in another world! This is the story
  of a boy wielding the Sky Poison Pearl, cultivating the strength to oppose

<h3>The Desolate Era</h3>
<p>
  Fate had never been kind to Ji Ning. Wracked by illnesses and infirm his
  entire life on Earth, Ji Ning knew early on that he would die as a teenager.
  What he didn’t know was that there really was such a thing as life after death
  and that the multiverse was a far larger place than he thought. A lucky twist
  of fate meant that Ji Ning was reborn into a world of Immortals and monsters,
  of Ki Refiners and powerful Fiendgods, a world where Dynasties lasted for
  millions of years. A world which is both greater… and yet also smaller… than
  he ever could imagine. He would have the opportunity to join them, and in this
  life, Ji Ning swore to himself, he would never let himself be weak again! The
  Era he was born into was a Desolate one, but Ji Ning would make it his era.

<h3>Release that Witch</h3>
<p>
  Chen Yan travels between worlds, ending up becoming an honorable prince in a
  medieval fantasy world. Yet this world was not quite as simple as he thought.
  Witches with magical powers abound, and fearsome wars between churches and
  kingdoms rage throughout the land. Roland, a prince regarded as hopeless by
  his own father and assigned to the worst fief, spends his time developing a
  poor and backward town into a strong and modern city, while fighting against
  his siblings for the throne and absolute control over the kingdom. Join Roland
  as he befriends and allies with witches and, through fighting and even
  farming, pushes back invaders coming from the realm of evil.
